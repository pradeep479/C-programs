1) In C programming language we are not allowed to assign a string to struct variable.( e.name="Pradeep") 

We have to use strcpy(char *dest, const char *source) function for assigning a string

For example: strcpy(e.name, "Pradeep");

2) We can reduce the struct size using     #pragma pack(1) as header file. 

3) num = num << 2 equal to the num = num * (2^2). And the new value of num is (i.e 22 << 2) 22* (2 ^ 2) = 88,
 which is equal to the binary form 1011000.
 
4)COMMON MISTAKES IN POINTER:
 int c, *pc;

// pc is address but c is not
pc = c;  // Error

// &c is address but *pc is not
*pc = &c;  // Error

// both &c and pc are addresses
pc = &c;  // Not an error

// both c and *pc are values 
*pc = c;  // Not an error


#include <stdio.h>  // here no error will be there bcz int*p=&c is equal to int *p; p=&c;
int main() {
   int c = 5;
   int *p = &c;

   printf("%d", *p);  // 5
   return 0; 
}

5) In POINTER concept *(ptr + i) is same as ptr[i].   [IMPORTANT]

6)Void Pointer: It is a form of pointer which is used to point another variable of any data type.
 So, it can store the address of a variable of any data type.

 ex: void *ptr;
     ptr = &i;
 while printing the i value you must use p("%d",*( (int*)ptr) )

 7) While declaring value to pointer array 
 ptr1[0] = 1;        
*(array + 1) = 2;   // all are same 
*(1 + array) = 2;  // *(array) means array[0]
array[2] = 4; 

8) how to find array count in c

int myArray[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
int arraySize = sizeof(myArray) / sizeof(myArray[0]); // 5

In this example, sizeof(myArray) returns the total size of the array in bytes, 
while sizeof(myArray[0]) returns the size of one element in bytes. 
Dividing the total size by the size of one element gives us the number of elements in the array.

9) Preprocessor language:

#define NAME(a,b) \printf(#a" "#b ) // Wrong error: stray ‘\’ in program

#define NAME(a,b) \                // Correct format and there should be no space between \ and printf like these \printf()
printf(#a" "#b )

Program:
#include <stdio.h>

#define NAME(a,b) \
printf(#a" "#b )

int main()
{
    NAME(Pradeep, Sriram);  // In here There is no need to mention the str like this "Pradeep"
}
